	(1,'how-to-cope-with-muscle-soreness','2015-09-01 00:00:00','How To Cope With Muscle Soreness','<p>You know the feeling all too well... The morning after an intense workout you wake up to discover someone put your legs and butt through a shredder while you slept and set your core section on fire. MUSCLE SORENESS strikes again. &nbsp;You know it\'s perfectly normal and can\'t be completely avoided but what the heck is making your muscles so sore anyway, RIGHT!? Relax, we\'ll break it down for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHAT:</strong>&nbsp; Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is the official name for the aches you feel the day after a workout. Especially if it’s the first day in a new program or after a long layoff. &nbsp;Soreness sets in 12-24 hours after a workout and peaks 24-48 hours after. Hurts so good, doesn’t it?</p><p><strong>WHY:</strong> High intensity exercise routines and exercises cause micro tears and inflammation in the muscle fibers, which result in soreness, fatigue, stiffness and reduced range of motion. Your body retreats into a state of recovery and is under repair while your mind forms a love/hate relationship with a serious workout program like FLO FIT. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>HOW TO COPE:</strong>&nbsp; While there is no proven method to completely prevent soreness after an intense workout, there are many ways to reduce the impact after it sets in.Ice bath&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;- A cold bath after your workout for a minimum of 5-25 minutes can help reduce muscle soreness by up to 20%Active Recovery&nbsp;</p><p>- A low-impact cardio exercise such as jogging or swimming helps because it forces blood to circulate throughout your body, not only warming the muscles but delivering oxygen and nutrients to increase rate of healing and allowing &nbsp;you to perform...</p><p>- Gentle Stretching - Stretching after a warm up (see above ) relaxes the muscle and reduces stiffness without over loading the muscles (making them worse). &nbsp;It also increases basic flexibility as it speeds up the return of full range of motion and prevents cramping. ( You DO NOT want cramping. Repeat, DO NOT.)</p><p><strong>ADAPT</strong>: - As with many physiological changes, your body will adjust to the new workouts and soreness should decrease significantly after future sessions. &nbsp;The more often you workout the less sore you’ll be as the body continues to get stronger. &nbsp;The first two workouts are the toughest in term of soreness, after that the body handles the physical demands much better. This is a process scientists refer to as \"toughening up.\" Not to be confused with over training.</p><p><strong>ENJOY:</strong> There is actually a benefit to the soreness you feel. &nbsp;Any activity by the body (in this case the repair of muscle tissue) requires energy so that soreness you feel is your workout still working for you. Calories are burned in the process of rebuilding muscle tissue, and while this seems minimal in one day, over the course of 8 weeks it adds up. Another example of how workouts pay off after they are over and why nutrition is just as important on days off as it is on training days.</p><p><strong>SUMMARY</strong>: It is a proven fact that high intensity training for improvement in a program will cause soreness. &nbsp;There are several ways to cope that allow you to maximize gains while minimizing pain. &nbsp;Though soreness may be a nuisance, it’s actually a reminder that your body is hard at work strengthening itself and all the while burning more energy in the process. As always, if your soreness turns into intense pain or persists for more than 5 days check with a doctor as you may have injured yourself. Otherwise smile and be glad you’re sore, you earned it!</p>','2017-01-30 11:08:25','2017-01-30 11:08:25','demo_blog_article','ddd',1,1,1),
	(2,'the-danger-of-training-on-empty','2015-09-01 00:00:00','The Danger of Training on Empty','<p>A common myth we receive a lot of questions about is whether exercising on an empty stomach is a good shortcut to burn more fat. On the surface this seems like it might work, but in reality it&rsquo;s a dangerous idea and a very inefficient one too. Let&rsquo;s break down the facts about training on fumes.</p><p><strong>What?</strong>&nbsp; After digesting food your body keeps energy for quick use in the form of glycogen stored in your liver and muscles. When you wake up in the morning your stores are about 75-80% depleted. If you begin exercising without eating first your body will burn through glycogen stores quickly and then break down muscle as a source of fuel. You can&rsquo;t trick your body because you can&rsquo;t fake energy.</p><p><strong>How?</strong>&nbsp; Muscle tissue requires more fuel to maintain than fat so instead of catering to high demand muscle and creating a bigger energy deficit, your body breaks it down and maintains fat reserves as a last possible source. It&rsquo;s called evolution, and you&rsquo;re not going to trick it. Yes, fat will burn in higher proportion to glycogen, but overall you&rsquo;re burning less of both and your performance will suffer.</p><p><strong>Why?&nbsp;</strong>Imagine a train sits at the station. Engineers decide not to load up on coal because they want to travel fast and light. As the train departs the station the engineer tries to go from barely moving to top speed. The train sputters and loses all momentum until it rolls to a stop. No fuel = No go. Guess what you&rsquo;re doing by skipping breakfast? Guess what you&rsquo;re doing by not fueling before a workout? You&rsquo;re trying to hit top speed with nothing in the tank. It&rsquo;s not going to happen because you&rsquo;ll crash. If you want your body to burn fat like an inferno, you need proper fuel to hit the fat burning stage. Hit it hard and fast.</p><p><strong>Why on Earth?</strong>&nbsp; Without fuel you might burn a bit of fat but intensity is totally compromised. What feels like a full effort is hardly half. That means your performance suffers. Focus is hazy and you&rsquo;re forcing your body to do something it isn&rsquo;t properly equipped for. The risk of injury is higher. If you don&rsquo;t have the proper intensity to achieve results and performance you need to improve&hellip; Why are you working out? If the answer is because a friend told you about this shortcut, stop taking short cuts and find smarter friends. Just like the train stuck at the station anyone who claims they exercise on fumes is blowing pure smoke.</p><p><strong>Common Sense Rules:</strong> If you don&rsquo;t have a big appetite in the morning or before a workout, a small snack makes all the difference. Try a banana or piece of toast with honey, something small and light. NEVER starve yourself to perform. Your workout will start slow and end early. The only accomplishment will be wasting effort and time. Results require real workouts. Workouts require real fuel. Use shortcuts and your performance is cut short. End of discussion.Don&rsquo;t train on fumes.

Your lungs a close 90%. The blood is 82% while your overall body weight is close to 66%. What are we talking about? WATER!</p><p>One of the most vital nutrients for your body, water plays many roles in your body and here we&rsquo;ve summarized some of the most important ways it affects your daily life and how to recognize when you&rsquo;re low. &nbsp;Pay close attention.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Performance</span></strong></p><p>Cramps, fatigue, focus, attention span, vision, reflexes&hellip; Everything suffers when you&rsquo;re low on water and the worst part is you can avoid many of these issues simply by staying hydrated. &nbsp;FLO FIT workouts are tough on their own, don&rsquo;t make your training harder by ignoring your thirst. &nbsp;Your body cannot absorb it as quickly as you lose it, so plan ahead and don&rsquo;t wait until you&rsquo;re thirsty to down a few sips.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Flush Function</span></strong></p><p>As you exercise you&rsquo;re sweating heavily and creating metabolic waste, so a body low on water will run into problems quickly if it&rsquo;s dehydrated. Not only does sweat help keep you cool when you have elevated body temperatures, but water also regulates body temp 24 hours a day. <a data-mce-href=\"http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-education/water-health-page2.htm\" href=\"http://www.freedrinkingwater.com/water-education/water-health-page2.htm\" target=\"_blank\">It flushes toxins out of your system</a> through urine and the longer these toxins stay in your system, the more strain placed on your organs (liver, kidneys, etc.) &nbsp;Stay cool and keep your sweat, blood, and urine clean to avoid and chronic dehydration.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Weight Control</span></strong></p><p>A tall glass of water half an hour before dinner stops you from overeating since thirst and hunger are controlled by the<a data-mce-href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/441564-difference-between-being-hungry-and-thirsty/\" href=\"http://www.livestrong.com/article/441564-difference-between-being-hungry-and-thirsty/\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;same part of the brain (hypothalamus)</a> and the signals for hunger and thirst are nearly identical.

It will also make you feel more full.</p><p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 24px;\">Dehydration</span></strong></p><p>The <a data-mce-href=\"http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/6-reasons-to-drink-water?page=1\" href=\"http://www.webmd.com/diet/features/6-reasons-to-drink-water?page=1\" target=\"_blank\">obvious signs of dehydration</a> of thirst but your entire body will have warning signs when you&rsquo;re low on fluid; Muscle cramps, nausea, dry mouth, dry skin, a feeling of weakness.

	(4,'outwork-the-outdoors','2016-06-09 00:00:00','Outwork the Outdoors','<p><span>One of the amazing aspects of FLO FIT is that you can do it indoors, outdoors and all year round for explosive results and a hard body you never thought possible.</span></p><p><span>As summer weather makes a regular appearance again and hard-core training encourages people to start working on their beach bodies now, before the summer strikes, we&apos;re going to give you a few tips to take your workouts to another level and head outdoors so you can look hotter than ever when you&apos;re carving that new, lean, muscle-packed body we call you.</span></p><p><span>EASE YOUR WAY</span></p><p><span>This will be the only time we ever tell you to do ANYTHING easy, and that&apos;s only if you haven&apos;t been working out regularly. If you&apos;ve taken the winter off, perhaps because you forgot the holiday binge was over in January, it&apos;d be a serious mistake and a huge injury risk to rush back into workouts where you left off.</span></p><p><span>For your first 3-4 workouts, aim for 70% intensity until the end or as long as you can, because stamina, strength, and control will need to be built back up. Remember that your recovery between exercises and sessions as it will take longer as your body adjusts. If you feel like you can push ahead, by all means do so, just make sure you&apos;re listening to your body, because nobody can catchup on weeks or months of inactivity in a week or a handful of workouts.</span></p><p><span>If you&apos;ve been off for two-three weeks, you a can probably come back relatively close to where you left, but will probably find yourself a bit short on endurance. Aim for 85-90% of your regular workout intensity to get you through, and within 3-4 sessions you should be back on top, and climbing towards greater results.</span></p><p><span>CHALLENGE YOURCARDIO</span></p><p><span>If the training calendars are a bit too much when you&apos;re trying to re-establish your routine, work in a few extra cardio days in between session, and remember to STRETCH and HYDRATE more than usual. No sense getting cramps or pulling a muscle that sets you back several weeks when you&apos;re just starting to make progress.</span></p><p><span>If you&apos;re looking for a new challenge outdoors, we&apos;ve recommended events like Tough Mudder, Warrior Dash and other outdoors courses that are fun, engaging and will challenge all your senses on the rush. Use trail running, stair climbing and your 8 Week Calendars to get you primed for the race, and do &nbsp;a touch of homework on what to expect so you are mentally prepared. We&apos;ve heard a lot of success stories from competitors who&apos;ve completed these courses and smashed the competition, and the number one word we here is FUN!</span></p><p><span>TRAIN OUTDOORS</span></p><p><span>For a more intense, alternative approach to getting outside, take some of your training outdoors.Find a park or field with benches and create a small circuit. Step-ups and squat jumps mixed with core exercises (mountain climbers, ab bicycle, planks,side planks) broken up with short sprints or laps are a tremendous way to use your foundation exercises in a new order with as much fresh air as you can breathe.</span></p><p><span>Another easy way to setup your circuit, is to use two or three stations. Use a bench as your starting point, and perform two exercises. Jog or lunge across the field for 45-60 seconds, then perform two more exercises, and jog back. This will keep you moving and sweating while giving your workout a simple and very effective structure. Bring lots of water, and for a better challenge, bring a friend or two and push each other.</span></p><p><span>With the outdoors comes a nearly endless playground to attack using your workouts, and with FLOFIT there are no limits to your results. Follow your Training Calendar, use the Nutrition Guide to fuel and properly and maximize your results, and let us know how you&apos;re redefining your intensity.</span></p><p><span>-Team FLO FIT</span></p><p><span>www.flofit.com</span></p>','2017-01-30 11:32:52','2017-01-30 11:32:52','demo_blog_article','ddad',1,1,1),
	(5,'how-to-eat-more-protein','2016-08-25 00:00:00','How To Eat More Protein','<p>Protein, the all-important muscle building nutrient. It repairs muscle tissue, forms antibodies to support your immune system, doubles as an energy source in times of need, and much more.</p><p>&nbsp;So how can you eat more protein when your busy lifestyle meets a demanding high intensity interval training program (HIIT)? We know that diet is responsible for 50% (at least!) of your results, so it&apos;s crucial to get enough protein to pack on lean muscle, burn fat, and continue on with the rest of your day while proudly crushing your fitness goals.</p><p>Today we&apos;ll look at several ways to boost your protein consumption following the FLO FIT Nutrition Guide<span>&nbsp;</span>so you can meet your bodies demands while eating real foods.</p><p><strong>SNACKING</strong></p><p>We&apos;re big fans of snack time at FLO FIT<span>&nbsp;</span>because it&apos;s an easy way to fill up on healthy foods in small amounts and keep your metabolism burning. You can also avoid greasy potato chips and other junk foods by choosing delicious alternatives bursting with protein and other necessary nutrients.</p><p>&nbsp;First up? Nuts and seeds. We recently posted on the nutritional value of various nuts and seeds like almonds, walnuts, cashews and flaxseed, and gave an example of what 100grams of each contains. The example? Almonds 21g, Walnuts 15g, Cashews 18g, Flaxseed 18g of just protein!&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Next up? Jerky. Depending on the source (beef, turkey, etc.) the precise content will vary slightly, but generally jerky, dried lean meat, is a great low-fat snack packed with protein. A one ounce (28 gram) piece of beef jerky contains about 9.4 grams of protein and a total of 116 calories. The one key to watch in jerky is sodium content, as salt is very often used in the curing process, so choose low-sodium options if available.</p><p><strong>GREEN PROTEIN</strong></p><p>Some athletes are still skeptical of the availability of quality protein through green sources, but don&apos;t let that slow you down. Additional benefits of green protein sources are they tend to be easier to digest, higher in other vitamins and minerals and lower in risk factors for heart disease, diabetes and other chronic health conditions.</p><p><strong>COMPLETE, INCOMPLETE and COMPLIMENTARY PROTEINS</strong></p><p>Proteins are made up of amino acids, of which there are over a hundred found in nature, but only twenty used by your body to form protein.</p><p>Eleven of those twenty can by synthesized by your body, and are considered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>non-essential</em>. The other nine must come from your diet, so are considered<span>&nbsp;</span><em>essential</em>. Animal proteins (meat, dairy, eggs) contain complete proteins. Green (vegetable and legume) proteins contain incomplete proteins, but when paired correctly, combine to form complimentary proteins that together contain all twenty essential amino acids. A great example of complimentary proteins is the classic dish of beans and rice. Whole wheat pasta topped with shredded cheddar is another. Sounds good, doesn&apos;t it?</p><p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p>The beauty of protein is not just in the fact that it&apos;s a filling food source crucial to growing a leaner, more explosive body, but it&apos;s also available from a wide variety of sources to satisfy any diet, vegetarian, pescetarian, Paleo or other. By identifying the many sources of protein in the everyday foods in your pantry or fridge, you never run out of options to consume it in a balanced meal or quick snack. In other words, you can eat more protein any time, any where you choose, and keep the results of your hard work growing by the hour with wholesome, delicious food.</p><p>&nbsp;Team FLO FIT</p>','2017-01-30 11:34:35','2017-01-30 11:34:35','demo_blog_article','cc',1,1,1);
